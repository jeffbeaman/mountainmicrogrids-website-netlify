### Founded in the Santa Cruz Mountains
We understand living in the Woodland Urban Interface (WUI) and that our access to beautiful scenery, outdoor activities, and fresh air come with some trade-offs.  One of those trade-offs is the (un)reliability of our electrical and communication systems.  Years ago that may have been an acceptible trade-off. But when most of your home has been electrified (refridgeration, lights, wifi, tv, computers, cooking) or you're working remote... you need to have reliable electrical service and access to backup communication systems.

### Reliability
Our goal is to provide a reliable, resiliant, modularized systems that can be repaired, upgraded, even repurposed at end of life/upgrade.  Lithium ion batteries are expensive, 5-10+ year investments.

### Designed for Expandability
As you electrify more of your household appliances or realize power outages are lasting longer than planned/designed and you want to increase the power output or the battery capacity...  no need to replace the entire system, expand just the modules/capabilities you need.

### Community Education
It's our goal to increase people's
- Awareness - where our energy comes from
- Effeciency - steps to improve your home energy effeciency (while often staying more comfortable)
- Independance - stretch goal of energy independance
