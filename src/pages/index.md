  title: Why Mountain Microgrids
  description: >
    We specialize in solar + battery backup solutions.

    
    Having experienced many local power outages (6x 8hr outages in 2022 alone)...  We realized there have to be better options than working out of the local coffee shop or putting up with backup gas generator maintenance, noise, smells, polution, running costs.

    
    You need reliable backup power to be comfortable, especially during a storm or emergency situation.
description: >-
  Mountain Microgrids builds battery backup systems which paired with solar and or mobile gas generators can help you weather any outage.  Systems can be scaled up provide backup power from hours to days/weeks offgrid... keeping your food cold, lights on, wifi, tv, cooking, all your modern conviences running.  

  Supporting 120/240v @ 20a (5kW) continious power output in our smallest systems... running power tools, starting fridge/freezer/hvac compressors is no problem.
