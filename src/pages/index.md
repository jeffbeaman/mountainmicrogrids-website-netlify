  title: Why Mountain Microgrids
  description: >
    Having experienced many power outages due to storms, accidents, power safety shutoffs, planned shutoffs for electrical pole and tree work...  there has to be something better than trying to find the local coffee shop or putting up with backup gas generator noise/smells/cost.

    With more and more electification (heating, cooking, EVs) in our homes, we need reliable power to be comfortable, especially during a storm or emergency situation.

  Mountain Microgrids builds battery backup systems paired with solar and or mobile gas generators which can help you weather any storm.  Systems can be scaled up from hours to days/weeks offgrid... keeping your food cold, lights on, wifi, tv, all the modern conviences running.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
