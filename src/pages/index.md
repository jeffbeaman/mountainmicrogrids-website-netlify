  title: Why Mountain Microgrids
  description: >
    We specialize in solar + battery backup solutions.

    
    Having experienced many power outages due to storms, down trees, accidents, power safety shutoffs, planned shutoffs for electrical pole and tree work (6x 8hr outages in 2022 alone)...  We realized there have to be better options than working out of the local coffee shop or putting up with backup gas generator noise/smells/cost.  

    
    With more and more electification of our homes (heating, cooking, EVs), we need reliable power to be comfortable, especially during a storm or emergency situation.

  Mountain Microgrids builds battery backup systems which paired with solar and or mobile gas generators can help you weather any outage.  Systems can be scaled up provide backup power from hours to days/weeks offgrid... keeping your food cold, lights on, wifi, tv, cooking, all your modern conviences running.  

  Supporting 120/240v @ 20a (5kW) continious power in our smallest systems... running power tools, starting fridge/freezer/hvac compressors is no problem.
